    <p>Driven by her passion to help others, Ying Ying is currently pursuing a part-time degree in Counselling while working as a Demand Planning Manager (Pharmaceutical).

    <p>An electrical engineer by training with a strong belief that design should serve humans and be for social good, Jeremy reskilled himself to an UX Designer. He obtained a Specialist Diploma in Mobile Applications and pursued a course in UX design at the National University of Singapore. While the two fields may be completely different, he found that the learning experience not only boosted his knowledge but helped him to work more effectively.</p>`,

    <h3 class="h5">NEVER GIVE UP AND ALWAYS UPSKILL</h3>

    <p>Mohd Nasir Ja’apar was retrenched last year from an oil and gas company, where he had been a senior quality engineer. In pre-Covid times, he used to be approached by recruiters all the time and was confident that he would always find a job. However, after four months and 60 applications, he made no headway in his job search. But he never lost hope. Determined to gain new skills, he underwent a 6-month professional conversion programme for advanced manufacturing engineers, and managed to find a job. Today, he holds the title of quality manager in the manufacturing and 3D sector.</p>`,

    <h3 class="h5">A SHOT AT A NEW CAREER</h3>

    <p>After 22 years as a police officer, Darrek Lau needed a change. He left his job, looking to update his skills and make a mid-career switch to an IT-related company. He took up an eight-month SGUnited (SGUS) Up-Skill Software Development Programme.</p>

    <p>The course, which was developed in partnership with Microsoft, equipped him with skills needed for the IT industry. Along with his previous diploma in Forensics, he hopes that his new skill set will prepare him for a different type of problem solving at his current role as a software developer.</p>`,

    <p>While many viewed the pandemic in a less than positive light, Jacp, on the other hand, saw an opportunity. Many companies were outsourcing their marketing needs due to budget constraints, and she saw a gap that she could fill. Previously a sales director at an online publishing platform, she was determined to take advantage of this opportunity by deepening her skills. As a result, Jacp took up a year-long course in Digital Marketing and Applied Management, under the SGUnited Skills Programme. Helmed by industry veterans, this course has helped her career tremendously, equipping her with the skills—and even courage—to launch her own digital marketing company.</p>`,
